            This version of the House Cat is by Random Wiktor of Corvus Corax. This is how she described her breed:<br/>
            <br/>
	        Housecatz<br/>
            This is supposed to looks like your every day, chubby, mix bred house cat. It comes in 8 or 9 colors, and is just kind of cute.<br/>
            <br/>
            Random created this breed for Petz 5. Conversions to Petz 3 and Petz 4 have been done by Minibyte. 
            The conversions are exact duplicates of the original breed. None of Random's coding has been changed. The file was simply ported to different game versions.<br/>

            Every year, millions of dogs are euthanized in shelters in the USA, simply because homes are not available.  These dogz have done no wrong but are simply the result of overpopulation, lack of spaying/neutering, and intentional and unintentional overbreeding.  While they have no "papers," shelter dogs make wonderful pets, as well as doing rescue work, police work, and therapy work.  Movies and TV frequently use dogs from shelters as their "stars," as many are very intelligent and eager to please.  Shelter dogs can be purebred or mixed, and are the best place to begin any search for a canine companion.
            <br/><br/>
            In this file, literally hundreds of billions of possibilities exist, as in real life.  (You can see some examples of these variations here.) I recommend you do not search for a specific dog but rather take whatever comes to you from the Adoption Center, like the puppy you found by the road or the one that followed you home...
            <br/><br/>

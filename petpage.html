                        This version of the House Cat is by Random Wiktor of Corvus Corax. This is how she described her breed:<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Housecatz<br/>
                        This is supposed to looks like your every day, chubby, mix bred house cat. It comes in 8 or 9 colors, and is just kind of cute.<br/>
                        <br/>
                        Random created this breed for Petz 5. Conversions to Petz 3 and Petz 4 have been done by Minibyte. The conversions are exact duplicates of the original breed. None of Random's coding has been changed. The file was simply ported to different game versions.<br/> 
                        Have fun!<br/>
